# Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

A project leveraging **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) efficiently by integrating physical laws into the neural network's loss function. This implementation focuses on solving the [specific equation/problem your project addresses].

## Features

- **Seamless integration of physical laws**: No labeled data required, training is guided by governing equations (e.g., PDEs, boundary conditions).  
- **Customizable architecture**: Easily modify the neural network structure to suit your problem.  
- **Robust solver**: Applicable to a wide variety of physics problems, including fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and more.  
- **Visualization tools**: Plots for predicted vs. true values and loss function convergence.

  




### Example Applications

- Solving the heat equation
- Simulating fluid flow (Navier-Stokes equations)
- Wave propagation problems
